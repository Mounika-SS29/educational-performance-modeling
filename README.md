# Educational Performance Modeling  
Regression and ANOVA Modeling using R  

## Project Purpose

This project was developed as a learning-focused analytical exercise to strengthen understanding of:

- Multiple Linear Regression
- ANOVA testing
- Model diagnostics and assumption validation
- Multicollinearity detection (VIF)
- Statistical interpretation and reporting

The objective is to simulate an academic performance analysis scenario and apply rigorous statistical modeling techniques in a structured, reproducible workflow.

## Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between:

- Study Hours  
- Attendance Rate  
- Participation Score  

and their combined impact on:

- Final Exam Score  

The analysis includes full and reduced regression models, ANOVA testing, correlation analysis, multicollinearity diagnostics, and residual evaluation.
